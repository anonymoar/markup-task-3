                        be&nbsp;cause of&nbsp;rain, Tricia Nixon was married today in&nbsp;the
                        Rose Gar den of&nbsp;the White House to&nbsp;Edward Finch. Cox, the man

                        When the rain let&nbsp;up, the President&rsquo;s diminutive, ethereal blond
                        daughter, who turned 25&nbsp;years old last February, finally walked down
                        the curving staircase of&nbsp;the columned South Portico on&nbsp;her
                        father&rsquo;s arm for the first outdoor wed ding in&nbsp;the 171‐year
                        history of&nbsp;the mansion. The marriage followed one of&nbsp;the longest
                        and most secre tive courtships in&nbsp;White House annals. It&nbsp;may well
                        be&nbsp;that the Founding Fathers could not have founded anything
                        if&nbsp;their deliberations had been open.

                At&nbsp;a&nbsp;social gathering of&nbsp;several veterans of&nbsp;White House trench
                warfare, barbs about a&nbsp;new addition to&nbsp;President Reagan&rsquo;s senior
                staff flowed as&nbsp;freely as&nbsp;the moderately priced white and red wine.

                The bantering had as&nbsp;its target Patrick J. Buchanan, the high-profile
                conservative whom the new White House chief of&nbsp;staff, Donald T. Regan,
                appointed Tuesday to&nbsp;see that the President effectively communicates his
                messsage through speeches, press events and other devices in&nbsp;the second term.

                with that appointment and a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;others made at&nbsp;the same time,
                Mr. Regan has also served notice of&nbsp;an&nbsp;intent to&nbsp;put his own stamp
                on&nbsp;the White House staff, according to&nbsp;assessments by&nbsp;White House
                officials and those on&nbsp;the outside such as&nbsp;lobbyists and politicians.
                The Founding Fathers met in&nbsp;Philadelphia ostensibly to&nbsp;revise the
                Articles of&nbsp;Confederation and sprang a&nbsp;surprise with their new
                Constitution.
